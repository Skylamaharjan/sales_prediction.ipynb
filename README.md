# Advertising Channel Impact on Product Sales

## Introduction
This project analyzes how different advertising channels influence product sales using a real-world style dataset. It's built as part of my learning journey to transition into a **Marketing Analyst** role â€” with the long-term goal of working for Google.

## Dataset
- **File Name:** Advertising_Data.csv
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (synthetic dataset)
- **Columns:**
  - `TV`, `Billboards`, `Google_Ads`, `Social_Media`, `Influencer_Marketing`, `Affiliate_Marketing` â€“ advertising spend across channels
  - `Product_Sold` â€“ number of products sold as a result of the campaign

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for regression)

##   Methods
1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for nulls and duplicates
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions of spend and sales
   - Created a correlation matrix to identify strong relationships
3. **Modeling**:
   - Built a Multiple Linear Regression model to estimate the impact of each channel on sales
   - Interpreted coefficients and feature importance
4. Insights & Recommendations:
   - Identified high-ROI channels for better budget allocation

##   Key Findings
